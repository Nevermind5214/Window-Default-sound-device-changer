# Windows Default Sound Device Changer
It literally opens your playback devices but you can pin the exe to your taskbar making it so much easier to access.

This is basically an overkill shortcut.

Also it's like 2 lines of code so you can easily make sure that it doesn't have hidden china data mining/malware.
